                              If time is TRULY limited, then what is Life? <br>

                              Life is a vapor that appear for a little time and then vanishes away? If someone
                              had told me years ago that life is too short and will vanishes, I wouldn't have 
                              believed and If I get to tell you now you might not believe either.
                              <br> <br>
                              For Billy Graham once said "I cannot tell young people how brief life is
                               "How quickly it passes" It even seems like yesterday we were given this mantle
                               of servitude right in All soul's chapel in that very evening, Calculating this time in

                               <br> <br>
                              Breaking this down it means; We have so far spent 11 months= 11 months * 30 
                              = 330 days. 
                              How have you spent each of these days?

 even with the advancement in Health, Science and Technology we have
 not averagely exceed this figure.

Average American male lives 70 years, female lives 73 years and 6 months
Average Nigerian lives 54.69 years (2019)

More live beyond this figure, and others below the figure above but the
average age is the mean of overall.

What a reality it becomes when you think and see you have a short life
to spend before it vanishes!



I'd write down my priorities in life and I get committed to certain priorities
in Life, Now is the accepted time, the things we ought to do, the class we
need to take, the books we need to read *DO IT NOW* The family you
need to spend more time with, "DO IT NOW" Money you ought to give, do it
now. Time to invest in study *DO IT NOW* People you need to evangelize to
*DO IT NOW* EACH TIME THE CLOCK TICKS ITS SAYING *NOW!* *NOW!* 

Today do it now for there may not be tomorrow for you or for me to 
kick start that Vision committed into our hands to do *NOW* Because there
is a warning attached to timing "It is running and will not wait for you* Time
is too short for indecision and procrastination. *"BE DECISIVE"*

TO A FOOL, Time is long but every morning we have 86400 seconds to spend
and invest wisely in a day, and every second counts. Each day the bank called *TIME* 
opens its NEW Account for you and me and IT allows no OVERDRAFT NOR BALANCE* 
86400 IS 86400 deposit in the account for everyy one. If you fail to use today’s DEPOSIT the 
loss is yours. "USE THE DEPOSIT NOW"

The bible says redeem the time because today is evil, If there is ever time for the
gospel has to be taught it is NOW. It is the quality of life and not the Length, Our Christ Jesus
Spent only 33 years and ended on the cross; to the World he was a failure at
that point but at the end of HIs life, He said I finished the work that
my Father gavest me. It doesn't mean if you living for let say 2 or 3 or 10 years but
will your work be finished?
A call for you and I to use our time judiciously!

INVEST THAT TIME NOW </span> </p>

                    God provides us with His constant love and care. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you, 1 Peter 5.6-7. Never forget that Peter wrote from personal experience. He had personally witnessed the love, care, and compassion of our Savior. Our God truly cares.
                    Now, how about you? Will you reach out to Him in faithful service?

                    God is faithful, and we are called to walk by faith and not by sight. (2 Cor. 5:7).

                    How would your life change if you committed to meeting with God everyday?

                    The writer of Hebrews tells us the Word of God “is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit,
                     of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart” (Hebrews 4:12).

                    There is a temptation for older Christians to settle into a routine — into a self-perpetuating "system" of Christianity. We attend church, listen to Christian music, give our offerings, and occasionally attend prayer meetings. It's very easy for the machinery of Christianity 
                    to act like a boat which will carry those who step aboard with very little effort on their part.

                    I'm a new Christian, and I want to learn more from the Bible. I have an old Bible that belonged to my grandmother, and it's difficult to understand. Where do I begin?
